    "Content": "Apple's AI Team is Breaking Up\n\nJust came across an intriguing piece on Bloomberg about Apple's recent shake-up in their AI division. It appears that Apple is dismantling its centralized AI and machine learning group, redistributing teams like Siri and robotics to other parts of the company.\n\nSeems that the revamped Siri, which was supposed to be a significant leap forward, has been postponed due to bugs and performance issues . Additionally, leadership changes are underway, with Mike Rockwell, previously leading the Vision Pro project, now taking charge of Siri.​",
